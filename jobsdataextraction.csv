 We're here to make money work for everyone and we're doing things differently. For too long, banking has been obtuse, complex and opaque. 
 
 We want to change that and build a bank with everyone, for everyone. Our amazing community suggests features, test the app and give us constant feedback so we can build something everyone loves. 
 
 We're focused on solving problems, rather than selling financial products. We want to make the world a better place and change people's lives through Monzo. 
 
About our Data Science, Borrowing team:
 
 We're looking for a Data Science Manager to help our product teams build the bank of the future. The growth of Borrowing products is a key component of achieving Monzo's mission to make money work for everyone. 
 
 You'll have the opportunity to lead a team of Data Scientists across our Borrowing Collective. You'll champion the use of data, bring ideas to life through rigorous experimentation and A/B testing. You'll help us get the most out of volumes of cloud native data, spotting opportunities to make each area of our product work even better for our users. 
 
 You'll help your team grow, hiring new team members and supporting their personal development.

 We are currently looking for a talented R&D Engineer to join us in shaping video compression and delivery solutions of the future. 
 
 BBC R&D has a worldwide reputation for contributing to, and leading, the engineering, research and development of many of the key broadcast and media technologies. The research work is mainly on new technologies which are expected to be rolled out over a 1 to 5 years timescale and require both in depth theoretical knowledge and a practical approach to potential deployment. BBC R&D is based in two main labs, one in London and one in MediaCityUK, Salford. 

Mission, Culture & Purpose
BBC Research & Development's mission is to explore and develop innovative technologies that transform the BBC and the wider media industry, supporting and shaping the BBC's mission and ambitions.
